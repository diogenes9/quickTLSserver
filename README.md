# quickTLSserver
python SSL/TLS server for header inspection, cookie-snarfing, etc.

This is mostly for my own use because I frequently need to grab a simple TLS server onto some machine and it's nice to have it in the cloud somewhere.

Lots of improvements could be made--I might add a timer so it shuts down after 15 minutes or so. That way, I'm not accidentally leaving a small web server of unknown security posture out there indefinitely.

This code was cobbled together from a few different sources--amazing, given how few lines of code there are--so thanks to...people
